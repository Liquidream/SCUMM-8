# SCUMM-8
## What is SCUMM-8?
SCUMM-8 is a "demake" of the [SCUMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM) engine (which powered most of the classic LucasArts adventure games, such as Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion) for the [PICO-8 Fantasy Console](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).  

A playable sample game "Return of the SCUMM" can be [found here](http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=29176).

Another example game "H A L L O W EÆŽ N" can be [found here](https://liquidream.itch.io/hallowe3n).

While it is heavily "inspired" by the SCUMM engine, it isn't a true replica (for that you'll want good ol' [SCUMM-VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScummVM)).  However, SCUMM-8 attempts to stay as true as possible to the [original SCUMM command reference](http://www.wilmunder.com/Arics_World/Games.html).
> *"Cool, so does that mean I can play those old LucasArts games in PICO-8?!"*

Er... no. SCUMM-8 cannot play those original games, just that it is intended to provide similar functionality within the (very limited) world of PICO-8.

> *"It don't work mate, waited forever and 'Monkey Island' never loaded!"*

Wow, really? You still here?! OK, once again. Think of SCUMM-8 as an even more retro "mini-me" version of the classic SCUMM engine. Most of the features are planned, but the experience will be... shall we say... "cut down".

> *"Got it. . . . so what about 'Day of the Tentacle' then?"*

\*sigh\* . . .  "Look behind you! It's a three-headed monkey!" . . . \*runs away\*

## Planned Features
- [ ] Game Editor?
- [ ] Game Save/Load

## Getting Started
Please see the [SCUMM-8 Wiki](https://github.com/Liquidream/scumm-8/wiki) for details on how to get started creating your own SCUMM-8 game, as well as the the full API reference.

## Building

Using Python 3:
```console
python3 build.py
```

This will output scumm-8.min.lua, containing the minified engine code which you can copy to your own cart. It will also output new copies of game.p8 and template.p8, which should be committed to the repository.

**Note:** At the moment there is no way to automatically generate a new template.p8.png file, so that must be generated via the PICO-8 editor:

```console
load template.p8
save template.p8.png
```

## Thanks & Useful Resources
A big thanks to [Aric Wilmunder](http://www.wilmunder.com/Arics_World/Games.html) (ex-LucasArts developer) for sharing valuable SCUMM documentation. 
Particularly the **SCUMM Tutorial **(1991), the example room from which was the first room I actually created in SCUMM-8 (minus the cool Sam & Max gfx, of course)

Thanks also to Dan Sanderson for his [picotool](https://github.com/dansanderson/picotool) - specifically his minifying tool (luamin), which enabled me to squeeze MUCH more code under PICO-8's limits.

Shoutout to **@PixelArtM**, whose [PICO-8 mockup](https://twitter.com/PixelArtM/status/758735822426284036) inspired me to wonder whether this could *actually* be pulled off within the virtual console's limits (SPOILER: it can... just about!).  
**UPDATE**: "Life Imitates Art" as **@PixelArtM** uses SCUMM-8 to make said mockup [a reality!](https://twitter.com/PixelArtM/status/857193912229933056)

Some other great SCUMM resources I found along the way include the following:

## Donation
As you can imagine, this project has taken **MANY HOURS** of my spare time to develop.  
So, if this project helped you out (and you're in a position to do so), feel free to buy me a drink! :coffee: :blush:
